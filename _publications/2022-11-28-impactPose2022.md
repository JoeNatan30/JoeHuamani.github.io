excerpt: 'Sign Language Recognition (SLR) models rely heavily on advances reached by Human Action Recognition (HAR). One of the simplest and most dimensionalreduced modalities is the skeleton joints and limbs represented with key-point landmarks and edges connecting these landmarks. These skeletons can be obtained by pose estimation, depth maps, or motion capture. For HAR, models are usually interested in less granularity of pose estimation compared to SLR, where the landmark estimation of not only the pose and body but the facial gestures, hands, and fingers is crucial. In this work, we compare three whole-body estimation libraries/models that are gaining attraction in the SLR task. We first find their relation by identifying common keypoints in their landmark structure and analyzing their quality. Then, we complement this analysis by comparing their annotations in three sign language datasets with videos of different quality, backgrounds, and regions (Peru and USA). Finally, we test a sign language recognition model to compare the quality of the annotations provided by these libraries/models.'

Sign Language Recognition (SLR) models rely heavily on advances reached by Human Action Recognition (HAR). One of the simplest and most dimensionalreduced modalities is the skeleton joints and limbs represented with key-point landmarks and edges connecting these landmarks. These skeletons can be obtained by pose estimation, depth maps, or motion capture. For HAR, models are usually interested in less granularity of pose estimation compared to SLR, where the landmark estimation of not only the pose and body but the facial gestures, hands, and fingers is crucial. In this work, we compare three whole-body estimation libraries/models that are gaining attraction in the SLR task.
