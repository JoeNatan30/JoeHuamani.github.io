I am a diligent professional who is always ready to learn new skills. Currently, my keen interest lies in undertaking research projects in machine learning, specifically within the domain of computer vision applied to signs, facial expressions, and body movements for sign languages and dancing. I am particularly passionate about digitalizing and preserving Peruvian dances motivated by my background as a Marinera dancer.

On one hand, I possess knowledge of computer graphics and basic statistics. Additionally, I have hands-on experience working with key-points landmarks, specifically in a multi-disciplinary project dedicated to sign language. On the other hand, from my studies abroad in Japan, I acquired a vision for process optimization and error reduction to generate quality products.
