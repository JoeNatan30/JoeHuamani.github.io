I had the honor of leading the discussion alongside Gissella Bejarano in the "Peruvian Sign Language Technologies" section, where I shared insights into various Sign Language Recognition model architectures and Incremental Learning strategies. Additionally, my role extended to serving as a jury member, evaluating the innovative projects crafted by students throughout the event. This engagement, organized by IA-PUCP, underscored my commitment to advancing accessibility and technological innovation in language processing.
